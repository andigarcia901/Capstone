# Capstone Business Questions

For my capstone, I used data I found on the Hawaii State website from the 2019 and 2021 data book.  I focused mainly on information in section 7 which is the Recreation and Travel data. I wanted to answer the question, "Where is the best area to invest in real estate?"

Taking into account area most frequently visited, visitor satisfaction, and availability of housing, I believe the best investment to make would be condominium buildings in Waikiki.  

I also explore the options of commercial real estate on outer islands and single family housing in areas outside of Waikiki for return visitors who would like to stay in a less tourist focused area.  

To drill down further, I think that additional data could be sourced for travel conducted during on and off season.  Other data could determine more specific rates to charge for optimal profits of a unit.
